  NuclearKid is a versatile package manager tailored for
  nuclear engineering development, streamlining the setup of
  a comprehensive development environment for nuclear
  physics simulations and calculations. It facilitates the
  effortless installation and updating of essential packages
  and libraries, such as PyNE, OpenMC, DAGMC, and Geant4,
  crucial for conducting nuclear physics simulations and
  analyses. The script detects the operating system, manages
  dependencies, creates a Python virtual environment, and
  installs the required components. With user-configurable
  options and a straightforward installation process,
  NuclearKid simplifies the often complex task of setting up
  a nuclear engineering development environment, making it
  an invaluable tool for researchers and engineers in the
  field.
