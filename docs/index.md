# Welcome to NuclearBoy

## 📦 What is NuclearBoy?
NuclearBoy is an efficient package manager specifically crafted to simplify the installation and management of vital packages and libraries required for nuclear physics simulations and analyses. It automates the setup procedure for essential tools like PyNE, OpenMC, DAGMC, and Geant4, making the life of nuclear physics enthusiasts much more convenient.

## 🚀 How to Get Started?
- Download the latest release.
- Extract it onto your local machine using wget or curl.
- Navigate to the NuclearBoy directory.
- Make the "install-nuclear-boy.sh" script executable.
- Execute the script and follow the prompts to customize your installation.

## 🛠 Installation Options
NuclearBoy provides installation flexibility, allowing you to choose your installation directory, environment name, Geant4 data library path, and cross-section library path. You can even opt to automatically download Geant4 data and cross-sections.

## ⚙ How It Works
NuclearBoy takes care of all the heavy lifting for you. It identifies your operating system, installs necessary dependencies, and configures Python environments. It also offers convenient commands for activation, deactivation, updating, and more!

## 🚨 Important Notes
Before running the script on your system, please carefully review it and understand the installation process. Safety first!

Currently, NuclearBoy supports Debian-based distributions. It compiles packages from source, which can be time-consuming. Our team is actively working on creating binary packages for internal components.
